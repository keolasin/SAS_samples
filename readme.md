# SAS Sample Code

Author: Matthew Reyes, MPH

This is a small example of my SAS data cleaning and preparation skills.

*/data* includes 4 generated sample datasets for maternal and placental variables, with primary-foreign keys of mother ID and pregnancy ID linking the datasets.

*/includes* has a .sas file which creates a format and 4 helper macros for data import and cleaning.

*/outputs* has 2 output datasets, one with complete records (the cleaned, inner join) and another with incomplete, left-joined records with maternal and placental data.
